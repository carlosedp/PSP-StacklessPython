It allows programmers to reap the benefits of thread-based programming without the performance and complexity problems associated with conventional threads. The microthreads that Stackless adds to Python are a cheap and lightweight convenience which can if used properly, give the following benefits:

After installing, take a look in the small GameDemo created using features from Stackless and PSP modules. This demo can be seen in this video provided by a user.

All releases follow the same naming scheme, for example: StacklessPSP2.5.2_R1.zip you find the name - StacklessPSP, 2.5.2 which is the Python release and a underline followed by a number which is the StacklessPSP release version. When multiple releases from the same Python version are made, the number after the underline will change.
